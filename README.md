## [Intrepid Reads](http://intrepidreads.herokuapp.com)

Intrepid Reads is a stand against literary provincialism. 

Intrepid Reads is a counter to feel-good ["upper middle brow."](http://theamericanscholar.org/upper-middle-brow/#.UynMyF5sjO0)

Intrepid Reads is a reposte to "20 under 40," the glow of precocity, and the fear of cultural irrevelance. 

Intrepid Reads will not ask you for an opinion on the new Jonathan Franzen.

Okay, really, Intrepid Reads is a single-serving site that recommends a book by a non-American author. Refresh the page for another book!
