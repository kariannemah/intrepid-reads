    Intrepid readers! I made this while reading <a href="http://http://shop.nplusonemag.com/collections/books-n-1/products/mfa-vs-nyc"><i>MFA vs NYC: The Two Cultures of American Fiction</a></i></a>. Perhaps you'll find it a slight corrective to the myopia of American literary fiction.
  In any case, this was made possible by <a href="mailto: ann@annmorgan.me">Ann Morgan</a>. The recommendations here were <a href="http://ayearofreadingtheworld.com/thelist/">collected by Ann</a> for her project <a href="http://ayearofreadingtheworld.com/">"A year of reading the world."</a>
