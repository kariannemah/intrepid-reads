        Intrepid readers! I made this for you and me while reading <a href="http://http://shop.nplusonemag.com/collections/books-n-1/products/mfa-vs-nyc"><i>MFA vs NYC: The Two Cultures of American Fiction</i></a>. Perhaps it can serve as a slight corrective to the myopia of American literary fiction, a gentle reminder to read more broadly.
      In any case, all this was made possible by <a href="mailto: ann@annmorgan.me">Ann Morgan</a>. The books here were <a href="http://ayearofreadingtheworld.com/thelist/">collected by Ann</a> for her project <a href="http://ayearofreadingtheworld.com/">"A year of reading the world."</a> I've removed the American titles and authors.

        For machines and humans fond of machine-readable data, here's the list as <a href="/book-list.csv">a CSV file</a>.
